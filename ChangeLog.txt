7/11/2019
started coding everyDay method

7/11/2019
changed everyDay method to use arrays rather than vectors as the graphing method TGraphErrors douse not alow vectors as input.

7/11/2019
Finished coding everyDay method so that it provides apropriate graph
(the graph will need to be improved when we can see wat it looks like with the oneDay method)

7/11/2019
Changed up everyDay considerably to allow for the calling of everyDay in LattDiff.
started work on LattDiff setting up to allow for calling everyDay

7/11/2019
Compleate rework of LattDiff No longer calls everyDay as I could not get that to work.
Reworked everyDay as we no longer need to call it in LattDiff

7/11/2019
LattDiff mostly finished will need some testing when I have access to root (tomorow)
Setup graph stuff in LattDiff to be tested.


9/11/2019
Added two functions to oneDay and they take different formats of input. oneDayMDI takes a specific day in a specific month as input while oneDay takes a day number (between 1 and 365) as input.
